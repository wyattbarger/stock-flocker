### DESCRIPTION


Stock Flocker is a social media website designed to encourage users to come together, and leave posts about their favorite stocks listed on the NYSE  indicating whether they look upon future price action favorably or unfavorably. The goal of the website would then be to attach a indicator to a users posts which shows whether they are "bullish" or "bearish"  on a given stock, and allow other users to vote up, or vote down the stock depending on how they felt about the original posters sentiment.
